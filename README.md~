This package provides tools for generating and analysing ensembles of Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs). 

# Installation:
python setup.py install


## Construction of RGGs
RGGs are constructed using a KD-TREE based method which allows efficient computation of the set of points within connection radii for a particular node. Once an RGG is generated it is possible to generate a `network class' object. The network class has methods for computing properties of the RGG such as the mean degree and average shortest path length. Many of the functions are based on those from networkx, however, the package also includes computation of eigenvalues using scipy's sparse linear algebra library.

## Analysis of ensembles


# Random Geometric Graphs

We can construct an RGG consisting of $N$ nodes as follows: firstly we sample positions $X_i$ for $i=1,...,N$ from a uniform distribution in the unit hypercube $[0,1]^d$. Following this, we then connect two nodes $i$ and $j$ if $|X_i - X_j | \leq R$, where $|X_i - X_j |$ represents the Euclidean distance between nodes $i$ and $j$.  A typical realisation of an RGG is shown in figure \ref{RGG_Example}.
